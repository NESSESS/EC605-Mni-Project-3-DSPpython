# EC605-Mni-Project-3-DSPpython
### Introduction

This is a very useful caculator,which can do laplace transform and reverse laplace transform,you can also see the figure of the functions

### User Story:

  People who want make laplace transform or laplace reverse transform
  
  People who want to get the figure of an function
  
  Students who are learning digital signal processing or modern control theory.

### How to use it

Before use it, please use pip install sympy to install the library.
You need to enter the functions in the box, remember that you can only use 't' or 's' to enter the function.

This is the main interface:

You can also do laplace reverse transfrom,this time we enter a transform function of an second_order system.
